#### Abstract
The classification of motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) is a piv-
otal task of the biosignal classification process in the brain-computer interface
(BCI) applications. Currently, this bio-engineering based technology is being
employed by researchers in various fields to develop cutting edge applications.
The classification of real-time MI-EEG signal is the most challenging task in
these applications. The prediction performance of the existing classification
methods is still limited due to the high dimensionality and dynamic behav-
iors of the real-time EEG data. To enhance the classification performance of
real-time BCI applications, this paper presents a new clustering-based ensemble
technique "CluSem" to mitigate this problem. Our results demonstrate that
CluSem is able to improve the classification accuracy between 5% and 15%
compared to the existing methods on our collected as well as the publicly available EEG datasets.
We also develop a new brain game - CluGame using this
method to evaluate the classification performance of real-time motor imagery
movements. In this game, real-time EEG signal classification and prediction
tabulation through animated balls are controlled via threads.

By playing this game, users can control the movements of the balls via the brain signals of
motor imagery movements without using any traditional input devices. The
source codes—used to implement CluSem and CluGame—are publicly available
